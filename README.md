Deep learning YOLOV5s model

## Model Overview
This project uses a YOLOv5s object detection model trained to recognize 28 classes of sign language gestures across a dataset of 11,000 images with complex backgrounds. The dataset was processed and augmented using Roboflow to ensure high-quality annotations and robust transformations.
